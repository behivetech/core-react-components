# core-react-components
These are a combo of custom components and components that pull from [material-components-web-react](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react) and [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/) following the [Material.io](https://material.io/) standards. It's in very beginning stages at the moment.

# TODO:
Need to figure out how to get the documents pushed again. Should be at [core-react-components documentation](https://bruquio.github.io/core-react-components)
